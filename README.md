Learning how to read instructions...

My name is Fern.  I'm an American living in Belgium. I've always wanted to learn programming but didn't have the time or opportunity to persue it.  Now that I'm living in a foreign country and find myself generally unemployable (for the time being), I've decided to take the opportunity I've been handed and I'll be beginning a new programming degree-course at the beginning of next year.  I want to spend the summer trying to get a head start.  I've heard that open-source projects are a great way to get experiance and hone one's skills, so I'll be slinking around reading some code bases, following a few projects, and generally keeping my eye out for learning opportunities.
